  On the 15th of August 2020 that is the day I first attented the Codetelligent meetup, for Mrs. Keo to update us on what we can expect on the <strong>Codetelligent BootCamp 2</strong> (oriantetion) at first I was not sure of what to expect because the place that we were meeting up at is in Inkanini Khayelitsha. So the first tought that came to my mind is that "will I leave my current job for this place?" but I waited for her although she was "running late" just to hear what she has to offer for us.
  <br>
  <br>
  Once she spake about what is this Codetelligent Bootcamp and what does it do, I was suprised with all the dedication she had although this place was in Khayelitsha. She doesn't even stay in Khayelitsha but because she had Hope for us that were can be powerful <strong>Web Devs</strong> that are based at "Ekasi(Township)". Ever since that day I never looked back I because I've always wanted to do Coding but I would teach my self at home then give up after a while.
  <br>
  <br>
  On this day I learnt that never underestimate your background or where you from but if you believe and stand firm in what you believe in anything is possible, and work hard to achive that and be the first person in your home to do it although some will say you're crazy but keep on moving.

  On the 16th of August we were split to different groups and given task to do a webpage of Fountain of Hope with only little experince and some notes.We asked our selves how is this possible because we didn't learn anything about HTML we only had notes but as a group we studied and some left because they can't handle the pressure that was given unto us there were only <strong>5</strong> of us who remained in the group but we managed to finish the webpage with Mrs. Keo breathing in out necks. 
   <br>
   On the 19th we presented that work to some experinces Developers and we were scared because were biginners at this game but it turned out they were very impressed with the work we had to offer , expetially with first time Web devs.S
